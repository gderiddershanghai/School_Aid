Welcome to the Teacher Aid App! This Streamlit-powered application is designed to support teachers by offering various functionalities to assist with feedback and transcription tasks.

## Features

- **Video Feedback**: Upload a video of a student's presentation or work, add some comments, and the app will generate comprehensive feedback.
- **Online Feedback**: Input the content covered in today's class along with comments on the student's performance to get a structured feedback paragraph.
- **Video Transcription**: Upload a video to get a transcription of what was said, making it easier to review and provide feedback.
- **OCR (In Progress)**: Soon, you'll be able to take a picture of a student's essay, and the app will type it up for you, streamlining the feedback process.
